Map.0=What do you do now?
Map.1=What do you do now?
SAnkunft.0=8:13 am. You are leaving the underground transportation system of Berlin, as every morning, at the subway station Ernst Reuter square.
SAnkunft.1=While you walk up the stairs and enjoy the nice temperatures, the only thing that dampening your good mood, is that you failed your linear algebra exam.
SAnkunft.2=You were unlucky. You are lacking two points in the exam, but you are sure, that you can get those points in the exam review today, by using your great discussion skills. But first you have to go to the MPGI2 (Basics of computer science 2) lecture in the room H 0104, to which you looked forward the whole last week.
SAnkunft.3=9.51 am. Fascinated by the interesting topics, you are leaving the MPGI2 lecture now. Too bad, that it is already over.
SAnkunft.4=You should really make sure to get the two points in the exam review now by discussing it with the teaching assistants and the professor. You really don't want to take the course again this semester.
SAnna.0=You hear someone opening the door of the dorm room from outside.
SAnna.1=You are aware, that you are not being expected. She is entering her room, lost in thoughts, but gets scared from your presence and drops her bag.
SAnna.10=Go to Anna's dorm room
SAnna.11=Oh - how nice: There is a ice cream stand.
SAnna.12=On such a hot day, there is nothing better than a delicious cold, creamy ice.
SAnna.13=You both order one scoop of vanilla ice cream, then you sit down on a bench at the side of the street and enjoy the mild summer weather of the evening.
SAnna.14=Yes
SAnna.15=No
SAnna.16=Do you want to try to infect the doorman by bringing him a ice cream?
SAnna.17=That could be a good idea. You buy another ice cream for the doorman.
SAnna.18=Go to the ice cream stand
SAnna.19=There is a conference about medieval literature going on in room H 0104 at the moment. You feel out of place between all those humanities scholars.
SAnna.2=Of course, she its hostile: _You_ are in _her_ dorm room. She screams at you, that you should leave now! But as she is picking up her bag, you see, that she is beginning to understand this surprising moment.
SAnna.20=You are handing the doorman the ice cream, which melted quite a bit in the meantime. 
SAnna.21=Out of a sudden, the doorman is really nice. He is smiling at you in a friendly way and asks, what he can do for you.
SAnna.22=After half an hour of superficial conversation, you hold the key for the small ceiling door in your hands.
SAnna.23=Set out for Anna's door room now, to finally save your linear algebra exam!
SAnna.24=You are kindly asking the doorman, if he can give you the key for the small door in the ceiling of the room H 0104 
SAnna.25=In spite of all your persuasion attempts, you fail to obtain the key from him.
SAnna.26=Maybe you find a way to convince him to give you the key anyways.
SAnna.27=Talk to the doorman
SAnna.28=In the floor, you see a little door, that should give you direct access to the room H 0104 from the ceiling.
SAnna.29=Through this door, you could lower the corrections for the exam to your table during the exam by writing it to a small slip of paper and attaching it to a string.
SAnna.3=She asks you with a analytical, but skeptical glance, how you got into the room. While she is holding to her bag, she squints her eyes and looks at the bruised time machine. For a short moment, you are turning around to the time machine, which obviously caused a quite significant damage to the interior, and then you try to look as innocent as possible.
SAnna.30=The key fits - you can open the door.
SAnna.31=But you have to do that not until you are back in the past to save your exam.
SAnna.32=Unfortunately, it is locked.
SAnna.33=You could ask the doorman to give you the key.
SAnna.34=Examine the small door in the floor.
SAnna.4=Half an hour later.
SAnna.5=In the meantime, you got to know Anna, the fellow student, a little better. As a matter of fact, she studies physics and found the part of the time machine, that you left behind in the ER270 as a return anchor, and took it to her dorm room out of curiosity.
SAnna.6=You explained her your problem and she is determined to help you.
SAnna.7=She says, that she is quite literate regarding time travels, and therefore knows, that due to the limited elasticity of the space-time continuum, it is not possible to use the time machine once again in a time frame, that you have already strained too much.
SAnna.8=Because the energy of the temporite rock is not enough to throw you back to a earlier point in the past, you have to search for a way to deliver the correction to you _during_ the exam.
SAnna.9=Leave Anna's room
SEnde.0=As you arrive in Anna's room, you can be happy, that the Anna, who belongs in this time, is still asleep. You don't really want to explain everything to her now.
SEnde.1=Anna explains to you whispering: "I am curious, where we will end up this time." - Certainly not in Anna's room, because it is not suitable as a landing place for another time travel, as the space-time continuum was strained too much.
SEnde.10=You sit down with the professor at one side of the lecture hall and tell him your whole story. Then he explains, that until now, he never heard or read a single word about the practical implementation of such a time machine.
SEnde.11=You are telling him all the information, so that he can tell you 
SEnde.12=This is, how the circle eventually closes. The story ends, when you are walking down the stairs in front of the ER building together with Anna - in front of your eyes the sunlight of a morning, at which you both exist twice.
SEnde.2=In the first moment, you feel uncomfortable, but then you look at him with a grin.
SEnde.3=You plug the time machine in the outlet, hold tight to it and then, with a fast spinning movement, you fly away to your destination, nearly routinely.
SEnde.4=Smoothly, you land on the time-honored floor of the ER 270.
SEnde.5=You quickly pop out your smart phone, wait for a few seconds until the device bumpily changed from the past to the present mobile network, and look up your linear algebra exam results at MOSES.
SEnde.6=It's true - this time you passed the exam with 42 of 60 points!
SEnde.7=You feel relief and it becomes apparent, that, without exchanging words, you both agree, that you are both deserving of some relaxation.
SEnde.8=With set steps, the professor enters the room - the same person, who explained to you earlier, how to build a time machine.
SEnde.9=You look at your watch and have to grin. You realize, that he is here to prepare the lecture, which is about to start in three quarters of an hour. It's the lecture, which you are going to visit and after which you are going to ask the professor for a time machine.
SKlausurBefore.0=You plug the power plug into the outlet.
SKlausurBefore.1=The time machine is now activated. You will bring you back to the morning of your linear algebra exam, which takes place in the main building, in room H 0104. The destination time of arrival is set to 8:00am, the exam starts at 9:00am. Hold on tight and hope, that you assembled all the parts correctly.
SKlausurBefore.10=Up there you see yourself sitting.
SKlausurBefore.11=You walk towards the earlier version of you. You are sitting there at your table and look concentrated at your A4 note paper, that you are allowed to bring to the exam.
SKlausurBefore.12=You walk up to yourself, begin to speak to yourself with sure voice, and say: "Here are the corrections for the mistakes, that you are about to make. Write them down quickly on your note paper and then pass the exam, I don't want to fail!"
SKlausurBefore.13=Your reaction shows, that you are obviously not sure, if you can trust your eyes. As a reflex, you take your corrections sheet and look surprised at yourself.
SKlausurBefore.14=The exam supervisor announces with a sharp voice, that the exam is about to start in a few minutes. He requires, that all present persons, that are not about to take the exam, leave the room immediately.
SKlausurBefore.15=Now you really have to hurry. Not only because of the exam, but also, because you remember, that the professor warned you, that the precision of the Heisenberg-42 tube is dropping with the length of your stay in the past.
SKlausurBefore.16=You run down the stairs with quick steps down to the exit, and as you are right next to the table, on which the exam sheets are lying, you trip over something and pull the exam sheets off the table with your arm.
SKlausurBefore.17=The exam sheets fly around the whole room. Some students already grabbed a sheet. The exam supervisor does not seem calm anymore. He is approaching you. He is fast.
SKlausurBefore.18=It's probably a good time to leave. You stand up from the paper chaos that you have cause, and you run as fast as you can from the main building back over to the ER building.
SKlausurBefore.19=Arriving in the ER270, you have no time to lose. You plug the power plug of the time machine into the wall outlet and hold tight to its stable chassis.
SKlausurBefore.2=In your pocket, you have a note sheet, on which you wrote the corrections for some of the mistakes, that you made in the exam. After you arrive, you will hand that sheet to your earlier version and he will correct the mistakes, because of which you failed the test.
SKlausurBefore.20=This time, the time machine starts to vibrate even earlier, and the same game starts over. The time machine starts to spin crazily, and you have to watch out, not to lose your hold due to the strong forces of the time travel.
SKlausurBefore.3=Nothing happens with the time machine.
SKlausurBefore.4=The time machine starts to vibrate a little bit. Remember to cling to the time machine, so that you don't crash during the imminent wild flight through the space-time continuum.
SKlausurBefore.5=The environment seems to dissolve slowly. Everything begins to spin. You ask yourself, if that is indented, if it is common for time travels. The spinning movement gets quicker and quicker, before you loose your consciousness.
SKlausurBefore.6=Your head is buzzing horribly. You hit the blackboard quite hard, now you have a bump on your head.
SKlausurBefore.7=You look at your watch. Its 8:45 am. That means that the exam starts in fifteen minutes. Hurry up, to complete your plan and return to the time machine.
SKlausurBefore.8=It's already quite empty here. The exam is starting in a few minutes, so you are probably already in the exam room.
SKlausurBefore.9=Many students sit here neatly at their exam tables. It is very quite for a room with so many students.
SKlausureinsicht.0=Go to the exam review now! The exam review takes place in room MA 352.
SKlausureinsicht.1=Oh - it's quite crowded here. You seem not to be the only student, who is lacking some points in the linear algebra exam.
SKlausureinsicht.2=You probably have to wait for some time.
SKlausureinsicht.3=Continue waiting to get into the room for the exam review
SKlausureinsicht.4=That all doesn't make any sense.
SKlausureinsicht.5=And now?
SKlausurRunning.0=Now it starts. Anna plugs the power plug of the time machine into the power outlet and then you both hold on to the machine, to travel together to the past. This time, the destination is the day of the linear algebra exam, 9:30 am. You notice that it's more comfortable to travel with the time machine together with someone else.
SKlausurRunning.1=And that is pretty handy - because you both don't want to wake up the sleeping, earlier version of Anna, who is still lying in her bed during your linear algebra exam.
SKlausurRunning.10=Anna takes the key, that you borrowed from the doorman, out of her pocket and then carefully opens the door in the floor.
SKlausurRunning.11=You have to be quite, so that the exam supervisors don't notice you. The door makes some squeaking, metallic noises.
SKlausurRunning.12=You carefully lower the sheet with the solutions down to yourself. The challenge is to place the sheet on your table in the right moment by skilled swinging and lowering of the string.
SKlausurRunning.13=Even though this method to send a message to the student who is taking the exam is really audacious, none of the supervisors notices it, because nobody expects such a maneuver.
SKlausurRunning.14=You put the solutions on your table now, and you appear to look at them now. You both have done your job now and you should see, that you get back to the time machine quickly, to keep the impreciseness low.
SKlausurRunning.15=Leave Anna's room
SKlausurRunning.16=Go to the dorm into Anna's room
SKlausurRunning.2=Quickly spinning, but quietly and controlled, you are landing together on the floor of the past.
SKlausurRunning.3=You both interpret Anna's snorting in the background as a good sign.
SKlausurRunning.4=Now hurry up and go to the linear algebra exam, because you only have little time!
SKlausurRunning.5=Leave Anna's room
SKlausurRunning.6=Go to the dorm into Anna's room
SKlausurRunning.7=The exam is already running for more than an hour. Realize your plan now.
SKlausurRunning.8=The exam is running at the moment - you have to leave the room.
SKlausurRunning.9=You now arrived at the ceiling door above the H 0104.
SPhysikVL.0=You could have probably waited there forever.
SPhysikVL.1=It makes much more sense, to look for other ways to correct your linear algebra exam afterwards. This is the Technical University of Berlin!
SPhysikVL.10=Finally you wake up.
SPhysikVL.11=The lecture appears to be over already. Except for you, only the professor is still here. He, exhausted from his lecture, is packing his stuff together.
SPhysikVL.12=Drowsy and still thrilled by the wild fantasies of your dream, you walk up to the professor in front of the hall and ask him, whether time machines and time travels are now possible or not, regarding our new findings.
SPhysikVL.13=The professor, who appears not to be surprised by your question, looks at you critically, but friendly. He blinks his eyes, tilts his head and writes with large sweeps on the board: "1 + 1 = 2"
SPhysikVL.14=He is slowly moving through the room, looks into your eyes and explains: "You have to see: In theory" - he pauses shortly
SPhysikVL.15=" In theory - it is possible to construct travels through the time without any problems."
SPhysikVL.16="Time travels and time machines and time warps and time worms - that all is, in theory, notably, not more difficult, than this easy equation." - he points to equation, that he just wrote on the blackboard.
SPhysikVL.17=Tired and not knowing, what the professor wants to explain, you look at him, while he tries to ensure with his analytical gaze, that you understood the principle.
SPhysikVL.18=With casual voice, he adds: "But you know, in practice, you know, that is of course not so easy. I mean, you understand, the practice... You understand, for sure, don't you?"
SPhysikVL.19=You ask him, what one would need for the construction of a time machine.
SPhysikVL.2=Maybe you find some professor, who will just give you the points without asking.
SPhysikVL.20=He briefly looks at his note paper in front of him and then says: "Well, at first, you would need quite an amount of temporite stone, then you would also need a stable chassis for the construction, a power cord with plug, a few small electronic parts - and a Heisenberg-42 tube, that's a pretty rare model, which is already out of production for some decades now."
SPhysikVL.21=The professor explains, that he has to hurry now, because he wants to be on time for the annual physics conference. But he explains, that the lecture hall, ER 270, will not be used anymore today, so that you can build your time machine here. He is about to leave.
SPhysikVL.22=As he is stepping through the door, he turns around for a short moment, apparently lost in his thoughts, and warns you: "Be careful with your time machine! The most important thing is, that you only stay in the past as long as immediately necessary. The precision of the Heisenberg-42 tube regarding space and time is getting worse with the length of your stay in the destination time window. Only stay as long as necessary!"
SPhysikVL.23=They appear to be happy, that somebody is interested in their additional supplementary maths courses.
SPhysikVL.24=They are not sure, if their supplementary courses can bring your points after the exam.
SPhysikVL.25=But they are definitely giving you one of their flyers and will contact you by phone, when they have found out, how.
SPhysikVL.26=Ask the intrusive supplementary maths course advertisement people, if they can change your linear algebra grade.
SPhysikVL.27=There is still an endlessly long queue in front of the room MA 352. :(
SPhysikVL.28=Ah. The physics building. Maybe they offer some interesting lectures here, that I could visit.
SPhysikVL.3=Or something like that.
SPhysikVL.4=Some students are standing around here, and they are excitedly talking about the good physics lectures, that take place in the ER building in the last time.
SPhysikVL.5=Even though this is one of the biggest lecture halls of the TU, then there not many students here.
SPhysikVL.6=The professor is talking with excitement about some formulas and relations. He appears to be talking about some practical applications of quantum physics and theory of relativity.
SPhysikVL.7=The room seems to be pretty overheated. You are getting tired and without noticing, you fall sleep.
SPhysikVL.8=You are dreaming of spaceships and quants, planets and photons, time bendings and time expansion and time warps and time worms.
SPhysikVL.9=You are dreaming, how you travel back in time and give the crucial hint to yourself before the linear algebra exam starts, so that you pass the exam. Colorful electrons and protons and muons and neutrinos are flying around you.
STeile.10=Heisenberg-42 tube
STeile.11=dusty Heisenberg-42 tube
STeile.12=One student is sitting here with his laptop. He seems to concentrate on his work.
STeile.13=You try to steal the student's laptop power cord without being noticed. If your time travel is successful, you will certainly bring it back to him!
STeile.14=He really did not notice!
STeile.15=You have the power cord for your time machine now.
STeile.16=Oh - he looks at you angry, stands up and leaves, taking the laptop and the power cord with him. That did not work.
STeile.17=Try to steal the laptop power cord from the student without being noticed
STeile.18=Search for all the parts, that you need to construct the time machine, and bring them into the lecture room ER 270.
STeile.19=The strenuous lectures can make you pretty hungry.
STeile.2=temporite stone
STeile.20=Let's see what they offer today...

STeile.29=Eat a meal in the restaurant
STeile.3=a bag of temporite stone
STeile.30=You grab the hammer. It feels cold and heavy. For sure, it's fun to knock on some stones with that.
STeile.31=You pocket the hammer.
STeile.32=Grab the hammer and take it with you
STeile.33=Interesting - there is a hammer lying on the ground in front of the maths building.
STeile.34=The walls here look, as if they are made of the rare and extremely precious temporite stone.
STeile.35=That's fun!
STeile.36=Indeed, it seems to be temporite stone!
STeile.37=You are taking it with you and will need it later for your time machine.
STeile.38=Knock off some hunks of stone from the wall
STeile.39=Back in the corner there is a blue plastic box.
STeile.4=firm chassis
STeile.40=You take the plastic box, sit down, and open it.
STeile.41=Those seem to be all the small electronic parts, which you need for your time machine! And also a Heisenberg-42 tube!
STeile.42=You are taking the plastic box with you.
STeile.43=Have a closer look at the blue plastic box
STeile.44=You are putting all the newly found parts in the ER270: 
STeile.46=For the assembly of the time machine, you are still missing: 
STeile.48=Hooray! You have found all the parts!
STeile.49=You are now assembling the time machine.
STeile.5=The tablet from the university restaurant for the chassis
STeile.50=You are done!
STeile.51=Somehow, the time machine looks different than you always imagined them.
STeile.52=You don't care, as long as this thing helps you to pass the linear algebra exam.
STeile.6=power cord with outlet plug
STeile.7=power cord of studying student
STeile.8=small electronic parts
STeile.9=small electronic parts
SWohnheim.0=You hit your head on the hard wooden edge of a table. While you are still out of breath, you try to regain orientation.
SWohnheim.1=You recognize, that you are definitely not in ER270 anymore.
SWohnheim.10=You resist your initial reflex to give up and think about alternatives instead.
SWohnheim.11=Maybe you use the time machine simply another time.
SWohnheim.12=Check on your phone, if you passed the linear algebra exam.
SWohnheim.2=You are in a small, but nicely decorated room. It is a little bit messy, but that could be due to your rough arrival.
SWohnheim.3=You are looking out of the window. You can read from the sun that it is afternoon.
SWohnheim.4=A glance on the watch tells you, that you arrived on the same day, on which you started your travel in the past - just a few hours later.
SWohnheim.5=Apparently, you are in the dorm on the TU campus - right beside the university restaurant.
SWohnheim.6=And the room, in which you landed, looks like the room of a female student. Judging by the books that are lying around here, her major should be physics.
SWohnheim.7=Look out of the window
SWohnheim.8=With your smart phone, you log into MOSES, to view your linear algebra exam result, which you hope to be different now.
